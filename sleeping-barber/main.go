//		- a customer must wake the barber if he is asleep
//		- if a customer arrives while the barber is working, the customer leaves if all chairs are occupied and
//		  sits in an empty chair if it's available
//		- when the barber finishes a haircut, he inspects the waiting room to see if there are any waiting customers
//		  and falls asleep if there are none
// 		- shop can stop accepting new clients at closing time, but the barbers cannot leave until the waiting room is
//	      empty
//		- after the shop is closed and there are no clients left in the waiting area, the barber
//		  goes home
